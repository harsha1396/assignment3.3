1.COMPONENTS OF HADOOP2.X:

The components of hadoop2.x are

HDFS:
HDFS refers to Hadoop Distributed File System.
It is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications.
HDFS is a distributed file system that provides high-performance access to data across Hadoop clusters. 
HDFS has become a key tool for managing big data and supporting big data analytics applications.

YARN or MapReduce:

It is a new framework that facilitates writing arbitrary distributed processing frameworks and applications.
YARN’s execution model is more generic than the earlier MapReduce implementation. 
YARN can run applications that do not follow the MapReduce model unlike the original Apache Hadoop MapReduce.

Resource Manager:

Resource Manager is a per-cluster Level Component.
It's scheduler is responsible to schedule required resources to applications.
It does scheduling and monitoring or tracking of those applications.

Application Master:

Application Master is a per-application level component. 
It is responsible for managing assigned Application Life cycle.
It interacts with both Resource Manager’s Scheduler and Node Manager.
It interacts with Scheduler to acquire required resources.
It interacts with Node Manager to execute assigned tasks and monitor those task’s status.

Node Manager:

Node Manager is a Per-Node Level component.
It is responsible for managing the life-cycle of the Container.
It also monitors each container’s resource utilization.

Container:

Each Master Node or Slave Node contains set of Containers. 
Container is a portion of memory in HDFS.
It is similar to Data Slots.
